# Computer Science for Insight
This GitHub repo contains the work I am doing for Computer Science 35 at Harvey Mudd College in the Spring of 2017. The class focuses on harnessing the practical powers of computing for application in other fields. Interested in politics myself, you'll find a number of my projects aim to empower citizens through improved access to and understanding of large, unwieldy data.

> Not replacing but eclipsing the traditional "CS for Software" mindset are the opportunities of "CS for Insight," i.e., computing with the purpose of providing insight to other endeavors -- specifically, insight that would be impossible or difficult to obtain without the tools of modern machines, their interfaces, and their libraries.
